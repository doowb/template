> What is Engine?

Engine makes it easier to work with templates. start and maintain static web projects by reducing the time, complexity and repetition associated with tasks like:

  - creating HTML "pages" for websites, blogs, styleguides, mockups or prototypes
  - creating reusable, custom templates out of common page sections or markup (like the footer of a page or scripts), or components (like buttons or nav) to make them more reusuable
  - using boilerplate code from frameworks or toolkits like [Bootstrap] and [Zurb Foundation]
  - easily adding mock (or real) data to pages or components

Engine's number one focus is to make the static web assets in your projects more self-contained, modular and reusuable across projects.
